This repository contains a Java code example demonstrating a common off-by-one error and an array index out of bounds exception. The `bug.java` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition and accessing an array element beyond its valid index. The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate through an array and avoid such errors.
